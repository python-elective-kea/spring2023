**Peer review** means that you will need to review the assignments of two of your classmates and provide feedback. The assignments you should review will be randomly selected by "Fronter" and you will receive a notification with a link to the assignment you should review. If you do not receive a notification, you can find the links to the assignments in the hand-in folder. This is a mandatory part of your assignment and you must complete it in order to pass the assignment.
