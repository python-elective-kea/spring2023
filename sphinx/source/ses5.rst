Session 5 - Utilities and Modules
=================================

Today, we will continue working with modules, focusing specifically on the third-party module BeautifulSoup for web scraping. Additionally, you will learn how to persistently save your installed modules (done using pip install) within your Docker containers.

Learning goals
--------------
After this week you will be able to:
       
        - Use python build in modules.
        - Find and use 3rd party modules.
        - Save and Share your modules installed in a docker container.   
        - work with markdown documents.
        - Work with the module BeautifullSoup for webscrabing.

Exercises
---------
------
Docker
------

Ex 1: Clone, build and run
**************************

* Clone this repository:
  
  * :code:`$ git clone https://github.com/python-elective-kea/clbo-alpine-dev-env.git`

* CD into clbo-alpine-dev-env

  * :code:`$ cd clbo-alpine-dev-env`

* Build an Image based on the repositorys Dockerfile.
  
  * :code:`$ docker build --tag test/python .`

* Run a container based on this image
  
  * :code:`$ docker run -it --rm -v ${PWD}:/docs test/python`

        
Ex 2: Node app and docker
*************************
In this exercise you are not going to code in python. The programming language used is Javascript, and the application is a Node.js application. However, the purpouse of the exercise is not the language but it is to use Docker to run an application. 

* `Build and run your image <https://docs.docker.com/get-started/part2/>`_

Ex 3: Create and run a 'Hello world' C application
***************************************************

`Solution <exercises/solution/04_modules/solutions.rst>`_

Based on this docker image: https://hub.docker.com/_/gcc create and run a Hello World app, written i the C language.

The code you need is something like this:

.. code::
   
   #include <stdio.h>
   int main() {
       // printf() displays the string inside quotation
       printf("Hello, World!");
       return 0;
   } 

.. note::
   
   | The approach is not different from what you have done with Docker and python files so far. 
   | - You should build a container based on an image (gcc) and 
   | - You should share a volume `(-v ${PWD}:/docs)` between your host computer and your container where your hello world file are in. 
   | - You should then compile and run the file in the container. 
   | Compiling and running a c program is new to you, and you will have investigate that topic. 


Ex 4: Docker'ise' your own projects
***********************************

**This exercise should be done in groups.**

* You should create a project that makes use of the requests module.
* You should push this project to a github account and all in the group should have push rights to this repository.
* The project should contain a Dockerfile that has a :code:`pip install -r requirements.txt` line in it.
* All group members should clone the repository, build the image based on the Dockerfile, and run a container with the right modules installed.

When this setup is up and running each group member should: 

* install a new 3rd. party module in the container. (look at `pypi.org <http://pypi.org>`_) 
* Create some simple (maybe even stupid) code that makes use of this module
* do a :code:`pip freeze > requirements.txt`
* Push the changes to github
* Pull the other group members changes and do a :code:`docker build --tag nameoftheimage:latest .`  

.. warning::
        It might be a good idea that each group member does this one at a time.

Python

Ex 5: Build a Web Scraper With Python
*************************************

`Solution <exercises/solution/04_modules/solutions.rst>`_

1. `Build a Web Scraper With Python <https://realpython.com/beautiful-soup-web-scraper-python/>`_
2. Find all relevant python jobs on this website: `jobnet.dk <https://job.jobnet.dk/CV>`_ or `jobindex.dk <https://www.jobindex.dk/?lang=dk>`_


Ex 6: Simple scraber with requests (and BS)
*******************************************

Do the `Ex 7: Simple scraber with requests <week37.rst#ex-7-simple-scraber-with-requests>`_ exercise from last week but now also by using the BeautifullSoup module.


Ex 7: From Html to Markdown
***************************

Get the html of this `page <https://clbokea.github.io/exam/assignment_2.html>`_ , and change it from a html page to a Markdown page. 

You can read a bit about markdown `here <notebooks/html_markdown.rst>`_

.. note::

   This should of cause be done "automatically" by a python application that you create for the purpouse.
